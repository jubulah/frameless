The point of this repo is not to criticize popular frameworks like React or Angular. We're not even saying this is a _better_ approach, but want to show that it is a _viable_ approach.

One doesn't need to reach for a framework 100% of the time. This repo has examples of how plain JavaScript can be used without the aide of a framework to achieve fully functional and maintainable projects.

## Demos

You can see these demos running here: [jubulah.com/frameless](https://jubulah.com/frameless/)

To run the code or develop locally, you must run a local web server. One way to do this is:

- from your terminal go to the demo dir: `cd frameless/demo/[demo_dir_name]`
- run a server: `python3 -m http.server`
- in your browser navigate to the local server: `http://localhost:8000`
